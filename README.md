## Preview

This is a game of trivia, with score counter and 10 automotive questions.  

## Technology used:

- I used javascript, css and html.
- I used background image from the internet.


## Approach:
I used an array to load questions and access true/flase buttons.  The true and flase inputs are compared in the array for the correct scoring and the total is tallied up.



## User Stories
- As a user, I should be able to start a new trivia game by opening the page or selecting reset.
- As a user, I should be able to click on true/false and see my score increment depending on the correct answer.

## What left?
- I would like to add a winner box and more graphics to class it up more.  I want to add a high score table so that all users have a chance to maek it to the top.  I believe adding a timer to the trivia questions will also be a future project. In the future I plan to add more questions or add a 2nd array with a bit more technicle questions for automobile savvy players.
