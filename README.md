## Preview

This is a game of trivia, with score counter and 10 automotive questions. I wanted a basic game to start with that would just be question and answer.  I decided to switch to true and false for a bit simpler user experience but in the whats left section below I outline some of the stretch goals for future enhancements.  

## Technology used:

- I used javascript, css and html.
- I used background image/s from the internet.

## Approach:
I used an array to load questions and access true/flase buttons.  The true and flase inputs are compared in the array for the correct scoring and the total is tallied up.

## User Operation:
- As a user, I should be able to start a new trivia game by opening the page or selecting reset.
- As a user, I should be able to click on true/false and see my score increment depending on the correct answer.

## Whats left?
- I would like to add a winner box and more graphics/animations to class the project up more.  I can see adding things like high score table so that all users have a chance to make it to the top of the winners board, add a timer to the trivia questions and finally add more questions or a 2nd array with a bit more technicle questions for automobile savvy players to struggle with.
